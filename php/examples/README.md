This directory contains example code demonstrating how to use the GoFile wrapper in PHP.

## Prerequisites

- PHP 7.0 or higher
- PHP cURL extension enabled

## Running the Example

```bash
php example.php

Make sure to replace `path/to/your/file.txt` in the example code with the actual path to a file you want to upload.
